# university-follower
A personal (for now) university subjects planner. It will show in a convenient way what you've done, and whats left.

Initialy it will only have the subjects for the Degree i'm aiming for.
This web app will let you follow the state of the subjects, wheter if its aproved, regular, need correlatives or else.
It will tell you if you need something else to sign up for x subject, and tell you in a simple your situation.

I'm getting redundant.

Later you could add your own careers subjects, discriminated by year, maybe your university. Have your own account.
